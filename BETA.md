# Synara Beta

Synara Beta is a packaged prerelease flavor of the desktop app. It is a separate
application that installs and updates side-by-side with stable Synara, and it never
shares stable's data directory or update feed.

## The short version

- **One branch.** Every PR merges into `main` as usual. There is no Beta branch.
  The release tag decides which app gets built from `main`:
  - `vX.Y.Z` builds **Synara** (Stable).
  - `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` builds **Synara Beta**.
- **Beta is named after the next Stable.** After `v0.9.2` ships, the next Beta is
  `v0.9.3-beta.1`, then `v0.9.3-beta.2`, and so on until `v0.9.3` ships. Never tag
  `v0.9.2-beta.1` after `v0.9.2`: it sorts older than the Stable it follows.
- **Two separate apps.** Synara and Synara Beta install side by side, with separate
  data (`~/.synara` and `~/.synara-beta`) and separate update feeds. A Beta update is
  never offered to Stable, and the other way round.
- **Data only copies Stable → Beta.** Settings > Try Beta copies the user's Stable
  data into Beta. Nothing is ever copied back: "Switch back to Synara" reopens
  Stable with the data it already had.
- **Beta-only features** stay out of Stable through one list,
  `BETA_ONLY_FEATURES` in `packages/shared/src/betaFeatures.ts`. The code ships in
  both apps; Stable just switches listed features off. Remove the entry to promote
  a feature to Stable. See [Beta-only features](#beta-only-features).
- **Diagnostics are Beta-only.** Beta sends redacted error events, raw crash
  dumps, and anonymous usage counts to a private dashboard. Stable sends nothing. See
  [Diagnostics](#diagnostics).

### Release ordersaddd

1. Merge the PRs for the release into `main`.
2. If Windows is shipping unsigned, set the repo variable
   `SYNARA_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WINDOWS_RELEASE` to the Stable version (for example
   `0.9.2`), then tag and publish `v0.9.2`.
3. Set the variable to the Beta version (`0.9.3-beta.1`), then tag and publish
   `v0.9.3-beta.1` from the same commit. With `SYNARA_AUTO_BETA=1` this tag is
   created automatically after the Stable publish.
4. More Betas (`beta.2`, `beta.3`, …) can follow from newer `main` commits at any
   time. Stable only moves when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is cut.

The rest of this file is the detailed reference.

## Identity

- App name: `Synara Beta`
- Bundle ID: `com.emanueledipietro.synara.beta`
- Desktop origin: `synara-beta://app`
- Synara data: `~/.synara-beta`
- Electron profile: `synara-beta`
- Executable: `synara-beta` (Linux AppImage bundle), `Synara Beta.app`, `Synara Beta.exe`
- Windows installer GUID: `a8e63b48-d4f3-4db5-9e12-368107afe65d` (separate Add/Remove
  Programs entry; the stable GUID is unchanged)

## App icon choices

**Settings → Appearance → App icon** offers Default, Icon, Dark, and Beta on
macOS. Windows and Linux offer Default, Icon, and Beta; Dark is macOS-only.
Default is the white Synara artwork, Dark is black, Icon is the landscape artwork,
and Beta is the blue Beta artwork. A fresh Beta profile and Reset to defaults use
Beta; a saved choice is preserved.

On macOS 26, Beta uses the app's appearance-aware bundle icon. Earlier macOS
versions use its PNG artwork. Explicit Default and the other bitmap choices are
also written to the macOS app bundle so they survive quitting the app.
Stable keeps its existing picker choices. It does not offer Beta, and a stored
Beta preference remains inactive without being erased.

## How it differs from Canary

Canary is a local source build managed by `bun run canary:*` scripts and updates only
through those scripts. Beta is a packaged release artifact: it is built, signed, and
published by the same release workflow as stable, and it updates through
`electron-updater` like the production app.

## Update channel isolation

- Stable builds follow the `synara` updater channel with `allowPrerelease=false` and
  only ever read the repository's GitHub Latest release.
- Beta builds follow the `beta` updater channel with `allowPrerelease=true`.
  electron-updater's GitHub provider reads the releases atom feed and takes the
  newest release that is not tagged for a custom channel — so if a stable
  release is newer than the latest beta tag, beta installs see "no update"
  until the next beta release is cut. Always cut a new beta right after each
  stable release.
- Beta releases carry `beta-mac.yml`, `beta.yml`, and `beta-linux.yml`
  manifests. The `latest-*.yml` files are uploaded on beta releases too, but
  they are inert there: stable installs only read them from the Latest
  release, which beta tags never become. A beta release can never be offered
  to a stable install, and a stable release never carries beta manifests.
- The desktop additionally gate-checks every candidate's version against its
  lane (`isUpdateVersionAllowedForFlavor`): beta installs accept only
  `*-beta.*` versions and production installs accept only stable versions.
  This matters because electron-updater's GitHub provider falls back to
  `latest-mac.yml` when the channel manifest is absent — without the gate, a
  beta install could be offered a stable build, and installing it would
  silently swap the app to the other flavor and home directory. Crossing lanes
  always happens by installing the other app, never by update.
- `allowDowngrade` stays `false` on both trains; moving back to stable happens
  by opening the stable app (see [Leaving beta](#leaving-beta)), never by update.
- Pending-update caches are scoped per flavor (`~/Library/Caches/synara-desktop-beta-updater`
  on macOS), so a downloaded beta update never collides with stable's pending
  update state.

## Cutting a beta release

Beta releases ride the same `release.yml` workflow. The lane is selected entirely by
the tag shape: a version whose first prerelease identifier is `beta` resolves to the
beta channel and the beta desktop flavor; every other suffix keeps today's behavior.

1. Ensure `main` is green and run the build-only validation for the release candidate:
   - `gh workflow run release.yml --ref BRANCH -f version=X.Y.Z-beta.1 -f publish_release=false`
2. Commit the version on top of the target commit (normally current `main`),
   and push only the tag. Release preflight
   (`scripts/verify-release-source-provenance.ts`) requires the four release
   `package.json` versions to equal the tag version, but beta version commits
   never land on `main`, so `main` keeps the stable version:
   - `git switch --detach upstream/main`
   - `node scripts/update-release-package-versions.ts X.Y.Z-beta.N`, then commit
   - `git tag vX.Y.Z-beta.N` and `git push upstream vX.Y.Z-beta.N`
   - The base `X.Y.Z` should sit at or ahead of the latest stable version so beta
     builds sort semantically as prereleases of the next stable.
   - `N` starts at `1` and increments per beta cut on the same base version.
3. The workflow publishes a GitHub **prerelease** named `Synara vX.Y.Z-beta.N` with
   beta installers, `beta-*.yml` manifests, and blockmaps. It is never marked Latest,
   never bumps package versions on `main`, and never publishes the npm `latest`
   dist-tag.
4. To re-run publication by hand, dispatch the workflow on the existing tag
   (`gh workflow run release.yml --ref vX.Y.Z-beta.N -f version=X.Y.Z-beta.N -f publish_release=true`).
   Publishing from a branch ref is refused by preflight.
5. Always cut a new beta right after each stable release. The GitHub provider
   picks the newest non-custom-channel release in the feed, so a newer stable
   tag shadows every older beta until a fresh beta prerelease out-sorts it.
   With the repository variable `SYNARA_AUTO_BETA=1`, the release workflow does
   this automatically after each stable publish: it tags a version commit made
   on top of the stable commit as `vX.Y.(Z+1)-beta.1` (skipped when any beta
   for that base already exists, or when the release just published is not the
   highest stable tag — a re-release of an old line does not cut a beta).
   Later betas on the same base stay manual.

### Signing

Beta builds use the same signing setup as stable. Publishing requires the macOS
signing/notarization secrets, and Windows uses Azure Trusted Signing or the same
version-scoped unsigned exception (`SYNARA_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WINDOWS_RELEASE` set to the
exact `X.Y.Z-beta.N` version without the `v`). The exception matches one exact
version, so the automatic post-stable beta needs Azure signing or the variable
set to that beta version, otherwise its Windows build blocks publication.

## Building a beta artifact locally

```bash
bun run dist:desktop:artifact -- --platform mac --target dmg --arch arm64 --flavor beta
```

`--flavor` accepts `production` (default), `canary`, `cua`, or `beta`, and the
`SYNARA_DESKTOP_FLAVOR` env var is equivalent. The packaged `package.json` embeds the
resolved flavor (`synaraDesktopFlavor`), so a packaged build cannot silently lose its
identity at runtime; on packaged builds the embedded value wins over the env var.

## Joining beta from stable

The stable app offers a one-click handoff under **Settings → General → Synara Beta**:

- **Install Synara Beta** (macOS) downloads the newest `v*-beta.N` release's
  `beta-mac.yml`, picks the zip for the current architecture, verifies its
  sha512, unpacks it with `ditto`, checks the bundle id is
  `com.emanueledipietro.synara.beta`, and verifies the code signature is valid
  and signed by the same team id as the running app (`codesign --verify
--deep --strict` plus a `TeamIdentifier` match; skipped when the running
  build is itself unsigned). Only then is `Synara Beta.app` moved into
  `/Applications` — then opened. On other platforms the card opens the public
  download page instead.
- **Copy my data and open** installs first when needed, then writes a marker at
  `~/.synara-beta/import-requested.json` and launches the beta app. On its next
  startup the beta server consumes the marker, snapshots stable's database,
  copies settings and provider secrets, then deletes the marker. The button
  first confirms that this replaces existing Beta chats, projects, and settings;
  work created only in Beta will be lost, while Stable remains unchanged. The snapshot
  uses `VACUUM INTO` when the source is quiescent; while stable is running it
  holds `state.sqlite` under `PRAGMA locking_mode = EXCLUSIVE`, so the importer
  falls back to a file-level copy of the database and its WAL, retried until no
  checkpoint or WAL restart landed mid-copy (it fails rather than import a torn
  pair), and vacuums that staged copy into a checkpointed snapshot. Either way
  the result is a consistent point-in-time copy and the outcome is written to
  `~/.synara-beta/import-result.json` so the stable settings card can report
  success or the failure reason. The importer stages every file first, rejects
  symbolic links in copied state, and rolls back normal filesystem commit errors
  rather than reporting success with only part of the state copied.
- Only a packaged beta (`SYNARA_DESKTOP_BUNDLE_ID` is the beta bundle id)
  consumes the marker, and only from stable's data folder (`SYNARA_STABLE_HOME`
  handed over by stable, else `~/.synara`). A stray marker in any other home
  is ignored.
- If stable's database has migrations newer than the installed beta knows, the
  import fails with "Update Synara Beta" instead of leaving beta unable to
  start. Any leftover beta `state.sqlite-wal`/`-shm`/`-journal` is removed
  before the snapshot is swapped in, so an old WAL cannot replay over it.
- **Open Beta** launches the installed beta app without touching data.
- The import button is disabled while a beta server is running so an in-flight
  beta never reads a half-written snapshot; quit beta first, then import.
- Launch/import are refused unless the running app is a production-flavor build.
- On macOS the beta app is spawned by executable path
  (`Synara Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Synara Beta`) with a sanitized environment:
  stable's `SYNARA_HOME`, `SYNARA_DESKTOP_SMOKE_USER_DATA`, and server auth
  variables are stripped, and beta gets `SYNARA_BETA_HOME` (plus
  `SYNARA_DESKTOP_SMOKE_USER_DATA` when `SYNARA_BETA_USER_DATA` is set).

The marker format lives in `packages/shared/src/betaChannel.ts`
(`BetaImportRequest`, `BetaImportResult`); the desktop side is
`apps/desktop/src/betaChannel.ts`, the download/install flow is
`apps/desktop/src/betaInstaller.ts`, and the consuming import is
`apps/server/src/betaImport.ts`.

### Local demo

Everything about the install location and data home can be redirected with
environment variables, so a demo never touches a real `~/.synara`,
`~/Library/Application Support/synara`, or `/Applications`:

- `SYNARA_BETA_FEED_URL` — base URL serving `beta-mac.yml` and the files it
  lists (for example a local static server). Without it, the newest GitHub
  `v*-beta.N` release is used.
- `SYNARA_BETA_INSTALL_DIR` — directory the app bundle is moved into and
  probed in first (default `/Applications`).
- `SYNARA_BETA_HOME` — overrides `~/.synara-beta` everywhere it is resolved:
  stable's import marker path, the beta app's own base dir, and the
  running-server probe.
- `SYNARA_BETA_USER_DATA` — Electron `userData` dir handed to the launched
  beta (only honored on the beta and cua flavors and source builds).
- `SYNARA_HOME` / `HOME` — stable's data dir (beta ignores `SYNARA_HOME`, so a
  globally exported value can never point beta at stable's data) and the
  `userData` base, respectively; overriding `HOME` isolates the Electron profile exactly like
  `scripts/verify-packaged-desktop-startup.ts` does.

The import copies settings, provider secrets, and a database snapshot. It never
copies logs, diagnostics queues, runtime files, other import markers, database
sidecars (`state.sqlite-wal`/`-shm`/`-journal`), or `*.lifecycle-lock`
directories — a leaked lock directory would make beta refuse to start while the
stable process is alive. Nothing is ever written into the stable home: the
marker and the result both live in the beta home.

## Leaving beta

Beta shows **Switch back to Synara** under **Settings → General**. It opens
stable and quits beta; on macOS it can also move `Synara Beta.app` to the Trash
(checked by default). Stable was never changed by the switch, so it opens with
the chats and settings it had before.

- Beta data is never copied back. Beta can carry database migrations and data
  for features stable does not have yet, so a copy could fail or corrupt
  stable's `state.sqlite`. The dialog says so plainly. `~/.synara-beta` is
  kept, so reinstalling beta picks up where the user left off.
- Stable is found through `SYNARA_STABLE_EXECUTABLE`, which stable sets on the
  beta it launches (with `SYNARA_STABLE_HOME` for its data dir), then through
  `/Applications/Synara.app`, `~/Applications/Synara.app`, or the stable NSIS
  uninstall key on Windows. When none is found the card offers the stable
  download page instead.
- Stable is spawned with beta's per-process overrides stripped
  (`SYNARA_DESKTOP_SMOKE_USER_DATA`, server auth variables) and `SYNARA_HOME`
  restored from `SYNARA_STABLE_HOME` when stable handed one over. An already
  running stable just comes to the front through its single-instance lock.
- The Trash step only runs for a packaged bundle named `Synara Beta.app`, so a
  source or dev build can never trash Electron itself.

## Beta-only features

`packages/shared/src/betaFeatures.ts` holds `BETA_ONLY_FEATURES`, the single
list of features that ship in Beta but not in Stable. `isBetaFeatureEnabled`
turns a listed feature off only for the `production` desktop flavor; Beta,
Cua, Canary, development, and non-desktop hosts keep it.

To put a feature behind the list:

- Add its key to `BETA_ONLY_FEATURES`.
- Gate it on the server, which is authoritative: resolve the host flavor with
  `desktopFlavorFromBundleId(process.env[SYNARA_DESKTOP_BUNDLE_ID_ENV])` and
  refuse the capability there, not just in the UI.
- Hide it on the web with a constant built from
  `desktopFlavorFromProtocol(window.location.protocol, import.meta.env.DEV)` —
  hide entry points rather than disabling them, and coerce any persisted or
  replayed value to off so stale state cannot re-arm the feature.
- Keep any migrations or persisted fields additive and inert on Stable; a
  user's stored preference must survive a Beta → Stable round trip untouched.

Promote a feature to Stable by deleting its entry; every gate resolves itself.

The list currently contains `omp` (Oh My Pi), `groups` (Hubs), `tasks` (Tasks),
`inbox` (Inbox), and `audio-trail` (message trail sound), all gated off in Stable.
The rail sidebar layout is available in
both Stable and Beta.

On Stable, Hubs are inert rather than hidden data: the server refuses the hub
APIs, Library routes and gateway tools, stops coordinator wakes and monitoring,
leaves saved Hub check-ins and completion evaluations unchanged and unscheduled,
uses ordinary Synara tool approvals for former coordinator chats, and refuses
creating a hub; the web hides the Hubs tab, route, setting, and
thread actions, and shows any existing hub folder as an ordinary project so its
chats stay reachable. The gate lives in
`apps/server/src/projectAgent/groupsBetaGate.ts` and `GROUPS_ON` in
`apps/web/src/betaFeatures.ts`.

`tasks` enables the Tasks list and delegation APIs. In Beta, Tasks takes Kanban's
navigation slot and preserves its saved order and visibility; Stable keeps Kanban.
A Beta client connected to a server that refuses Tasks returns to Kanban.

`inbox` is the Inbox page: the server refuses its `stats.getRecap` RPC on Stable, the
web hides its rail and sidebar entries and redirects the route, and a saved rail or
sidebar order that mentions it is ignored there.

`audio-trail` is opt-in under **Settings → Chat → Message trail sound** on macOS
desktop. It follows system audio (macOS 14.2+), the microphone, or both. The
desktop IPC handler is authoritative and refuses Stable and other platforms;
the web hides the selector there and leaves saved preferences inert. Only
loudness levels are sent to the trail, and the reader stops when the visible
trail no longer subscribes. First use can request macOS audio access.

## Diagnostics

Beta builds ship always-on diagnostics — crash reports plus anonymous usage
counts (which providers are used, how many chats and turns) — while stable
builds contain no sender code at all. See [diagnostics.md](docs/diagnostics.md) for
exactly what is collected, what usage counters exclude, and how the Cloudflare
ingest works.

## Data

Without an explicit import, beta starts with an empty `~/.synara-beta` home. It
does not copy, share, or migrate stable (`~/.synara`) or Canary
(`~/.synara-canary`) data on its own. Both apps can run at the same time: the
server binds an ephemeral port, single-instance locks are scoped per Electron
`userData`, and provider secrets are file-scoped inside each home.
