/**
 * startupTurnReconciliation - heal restart-orphaned turns at server boot.
 *
 * Provider runtimes (Codex app-server, ACP children, etc.) are purely
 * in-memory: every one of them dies with the server process. A turn only
 * leaves the "running" state when its runtime emits a terminal event, so any
 * turn that was still in flight when the process exited has no surviving runtime
 * to ever complete it. After a restart its persisted projection rows still say
 * `session.status = "running"` / `activeTurnId != null` / `latestTurn = running`,
 * and the UI shows "Working" forever (observed in the wild as multi-hour stuck
 * turns).
 *
 * `projectionPipeline.bootstrap` faithfully replays the event log into the
 * projection tables, so it restores that stale "running" state verbatim — it is
 * not its job to second-guess history. This module runs once, immediately after
 * bootstrap and before the server starts accepting client commands, and emits
 * stale pending-request failure activities plus a terminal
 * `thread.session.set { status: "interrupted", activeTurnId: null }` for each
 * orphaned thread. That reuses the normal event-sourced path: activity handlers
 * resolve dead approval/user-input requests, and the projection's session-set
 * handler closes the newest still-open turn (`finalizeTurnStateFromSessionStatus`
 * → "interrupted", with `completedAt`), so the UI clears blocked composers and
 * spinners instead of hanging.
 *
 * The runtime idle watchdog (AcpTurnIdleWatchdog) only protects turns started in
 * the *current* process; this is its restart-time counterpart for turns
 * orphaned by a process boundary the watchdog never saw. The same argument
 * applies to unresolved approval/user-input interactions, whose answer callback
 * is equally in-memory: their durable rows are settled here too, which is the
 * boot-time counterpart to the turn/session-scoped settlement in
 * `Layers/ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts` (that one reacts to runtime events, and a
 * hard-killed process emits none).
