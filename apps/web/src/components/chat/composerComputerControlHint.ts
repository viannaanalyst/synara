// Purpose: Visibility rule and copy for the composer hint that suggests Medium
//   effort while a chat drives the desktop. Desktop turns are dominated by
//   per-step model think time, and the act loop ("look at the screenshot, click
//   the obvious thing") reads the same at Medium as at High.
// Layer: Chat composer state helpers
// Exports: shouldShowComputerControlEffortHint + hint constants
// Depends on: resolved composer trait selection (composerTraits)
